### Hi, I'm Kate.

I graduated with my MS in Physical Chemistry at the end of 2014.  I had my first taste of programming in grad school (good old Fortran!) and started learning Python a few years later, primarily for data analysis and graphing.  In 2021 I decided to take my career in a different direction and did a batch at the Recurse Center where I started learning JavaScript and web development.  Check out some of my projects [here!](https://radicalprecursor.github.io)

- ⚗️ Fun Chemistry Fact: While alchemists could never make gold, but as early as the 14th century some had worked out an acid cocktail that will *dissolve* gold, which is far more metal if you ask me
