### Hi, I'm Kate.

I'm a full stack developer in New York, doing software full time since 2021.  I'm also a bit of an enthusiast for languages, studying history through the lens of technological development, analyzing data, and solving puzzles (which have all joined forces in a project I'm working on now, Encipherment).

Other fun about-me: I was a chemist in my past life, and still always happy to talk science! 👩‍🔬
